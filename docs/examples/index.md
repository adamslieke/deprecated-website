# Example Projects

Ever wondered how a fully reproducible and automated project may look like? Get inspired here by accessing one of our example projects!

## 1. A Simple `Make` Pipeline with R and Latex

[In this example](https://github.com/rgreminger/example-make-workflow), you
find a simple `make` pipeline, which prepares (`data-preparation`) and analyzes (`analysis`)
data using R, and creates some tables for a paper (`paper`) using Latex.

This is probably the most simplistic but still complete workflow, and
thus highly recommended as a template to kickstart your projects.

Checkout [Rafael's GitHub repository](https://github.com/rgreminger/example-make-workflow) for all
the details! Fork it/use it as a template - contributions appreciated!

## 2. The TiSEM AirBnB repository

Using publicly available data from AirBnB (available via [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)), we
illustrate how a reproducible workflow may look like in practice.

Check out our [GitHub repository for all the details on how to clone the project and run it](https://github.com/hannesdatta/tisem-airbnb).

We've crafted this project to run

- platform-independent (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- across a diverse set of software programs (Stata, Python, R)
- producing an entire (mock) paper, including modules that
    - download data from Kaggle,
    - prepare data for analysis,
    - run a simple analysis,
    - produce a paper with output tables and figures.

!!! warning
        This repository is still work-in-progress.

## 3. The webscraper repository

Check out our [GitHub repository with a few web scrapers](https://github.com/hannesdatta/scraping_workshop) that illustrate our thinking of how to code up data collections.

      The repository is still work-in-progress.
